# Decisions, and why

Why this repository is shaped the way it is. Read it before changing how the
system works, and add a row when a decision changes. Notes, findings and
articles about the project live outside the repo.

## What this project is

A deliberately small, deliberately real design system used to test **how
designers and AI can work together on a real codebase without drift**, and to
teach that workflow. It is not a product. Every decision optimises for
*legible and demonstrable*, not for scale.

Christine Vallaure — founder of moonlearning.io, trains designers in
design-to-code, Figma and AI workflows. The audience for this repo is
designers learning to prototype against real components.

## The thesis being tested

Prototyping with only a codebase and an LLM is a **drift guarantee**. With the
right guardrails, you can mix code and Figma creatively:

```
research (Miro) → prototype in code on `design` → push to Figma
  → design freely there → push back as a prototype made of components
  that already exist → hand off → production code on a feature branch
```

Figma is **not** the source of truth. Code is. Figma is an exploration surface
fed by code — a sketchpad that speaks the system's vocabulary.

## Decisions made, and why

| Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| **JSON is the token source of truth**, CSS is generated | One file per design decision, and the same file maps to Figma variables |
| **DTCG format** (`$value`/`$type`) | The actual W3C standard; Brad's Eddie uses the older `value`/`type` form |
| **Two tiers, not three** | Eddie has a component tier; 42 components need none yet. Documented as the extension point |
| **Brad's `background`/`content`/`border`** colour categories | The role colours are genuinely multi-role — `accent` was used 17× as content, 15× as background, 9× as a border under one name that carried no intent |
| **Primitives are named Brad's way: group → colour → step** (2026-09-14) | Follows Eddie's tier 1 (`brand`, `neutral`, `utility`): `neutral` (white named, 50–950), `brand.blue`, `utility.green` / `yellow` / `red`. The old `success` / `warning` / `danger` ramps put meaning into tier 1, which only tier 2 should carry — a red that is not an error had no honest name. Semantic names are unchanged, so no component moved. Figma variables were renamed in place, so every alias and binding survived. `yellow` is Eddie's word; the values are the amber ramp |
| **No Code Connect** | A per-component binding file, maintained by hand, Figma-proprietary, rots when either side changes. A second sync surface |
| **Component contracts instead** | The manifest already publishes the contract. Generate the Figma library from it and names match *by construction* — nothing to bind |
| **Validate is warn-only** | It must never block a designer mid-prototype. `--strict` exists for CI |
| **No Steel Curtain** (Brad's station 8) | Explicitly out of scope. This is a teaching instrument, not a team shipping to production |
| **Chromatic for publishing** | Per-branch deploys, which is what `docs/branching.md` already promises for `design` |
| **`design` is one-way** | A source of decisions, not a source of merges. Accepted prototypes get rebuilt on `feature/*` |
| **Figma name = token path**, `.` → `/` | One rule, no exceptions: `color.background.accent` is `color/background/accent`. It is what the round-trip name check will test |
| **WEB code syntax on every variable** | Dev Mode shows `var(--pds-…)`, not hex, so a Figma selection points straight back at code |
| **Inter and Roboto Mono, in code and Figma** (2026-09-23) | Code used to name no font, only system stacks, so the system had no typographic voice and Figma could only guess (SF Pro and SF Mono on a Mac, Inter and Roboto Mono in Figma). Both are now self-hosted in `src/fonts/` (four woff2 files from Google Fonts, 190 KB, OFL) and named first in `font.sans` and `font.mono`; the system stacks stay behind them as fallback. Files, not an npm package, so the no-dependencies rule holds |
| **Composite type as resolved-px variables** | `typography/<style>/line-height` holds pixels (24 × 1.2 = 28.8) with code syntax pointing at the real CSS variable, so all five properties of every text style are bound. Renders identically; does not follow a font-size change on its own |
| **Figma properties use the code's names** | `variant=primary`, `size=md`, `disabled=false`, text property `children` — not Figma's usual `Size=Medium`. A frame coming back resolves to the component that already exists |
| **Code parts become boolean properties named after them** | `Card.Header`, `Card.Description`, `Card.Footer`, so a Figma instance says which parts to render |
| **Components are built from the stylesheet** | A parser maps each declaration in `*.module.css` through the naming contract to a variable, or flags it as raw. Nothing is transcribed by hand |
| **Prototype docs are generated from their own source** | A real `Card` and a hand-rolled `<div>` render identically, so a designer cannot audit composition in the browser. Each prototype story reads its own file (`?raw`) and derives "Show code" and a *Components used* table from it (`src/patterns/prototypeDocs.ts`) |
| **Components take type from text styles** (2026-09-10) | 55 of 102 component text rules matched no text style. Added five roles that already existed in practice — `caption`, `label-lg`, `label-xl`, `title-sm`, `title-md` (8 → 13 styles) — and snapped 24 near-misses to existing styles (form labels to `label-md`, dialog titles to `heading-xl`, small badge/avatar and group labels to `label-sm`). `validate` rule `raw-type-in-component` now flags a hand-set size, line height or letter spacing. This is what lets Figma bind text styles instead of loose variables |
| **Text-style structure follows Eddie; names and sizes stay ours** (2026-09-10) | Compared against Brad's `eddie-design-tokens`. Adopted: a style carries six properties including `text-transform` (maps to Case in Figma), so the uppercase group labels became a style (`overline`) instead of a one-off rule; a style is applied whole (`validate` rule `text-style-split`, the no-SCSS equivalent of his mixin); every style has a when-to-use `$description`; breakpoints are named and described by width, not device. Kept ours: t-shirt scale names, ratio line heights, breakpoints as tokens, two tiers |
| **One name per concept, before Figma** (2026-09-10) | Names cross into Figma as property names, so they are fixed while nothing consumes them. Meter's `tone` became `variant`, like every other colour choice. Kept apart on purpose: Alert's `info` is a *status*, Badge's `accent` is *emphasis* — merging them loses the meaning. Toggle's `iconOnly` and `IconButton` stay separate components, because a Toggle holds a pressed state |
| **Two long-lived branches, not three** (2026-09-10) | `main` is the system, `design` the playground, `feature/*` in between. `develop` was a team-sized layer that a solo maintainer and a class of students do not need. The repo becomes a GitHub template so each student gets both branches. `design` stays one-way — that rule is the lesson |
| **Page CSS lays out; it does not draw** | `validate` rule `surface-in-page`: a background, border, shadow or radius in pattern CSS is usually a component rebuilt from divs. Known gaps opt out in place with `/* validate-allow: surface — reason */`, so every exception carries its reason |
| **Skills are named after what they do** (2026-09-23) | `figma-mirror` became `figma-library-from-code`: "Figma Mirror" is already an app, and the name did not say what the skill makes. It sits next to `storybook-figma-sync`: one builds the Figma library from the code, the other builds screens from that library. Dated reports from before keep the old name |
| **The gaps file has a fixed shape** (2026-09-28) | `figma/GAPS.md` mixed permanent decisions with bugs, open questions and unchecked work, and its header said every entry was a decision. Now: *Different on purpose* (permanent), *Left out on purpose*, and *Open* (dated), every entry, table rows included, marked 🎨 Figma limit, 📌 our choice, 🔄 Figma behind, 🐞 code bug, ❓ not decided or 👁 not checked; open entries say what closes them. 📌 keeps the tables honest: hover, motion and validation states are left out by our contract, not because Figma cannot show them. Both Figma skills ship `GAPS.template.md` and create the file from it, so a team that installs only a skill gets the same file. Form, ScrollArea and ContextMenu are now listed as left out, closing the inspection's finding that the file claimed "anything not listed is expected to match" while they were missing |
| **Pancake DS: forked, renamed, prefix `pds`** (2026-10-01) | The system is now Julia Sakakibara's own, based on Christine Vallaure's `ds-base-ui` (MIT, credited in README and LICENSE). Every custom property moved from `--sds-*` to `--pds-*` so nothing in a consuming app can collide with the upstream system. The Figma library still carries the old names until it is re-synced; `validate` reports that drift, as designed |
| **Neutral greys and a `#0A5CFF` accent** (2026-10-01) | `neutral` is now pure grey, anchored on `#fafafa` (50) and `#212121` (900), with every other step matched to the luminance of the old cool ramp so no contrast pair got worse. `brand.indigo` became `brand.blue`, 600 = `#0A5CFF` (5.27:1 on white). Dark mode uses blue 400 with `neutral.950` text on accent fills: white on any blue light enough to read on a dark page fails 4.5:1 |
| **Random palettes with randoma11y — an exception to "no dependencies"** (2026-10-01) | Asked for by the owner. `randoma11y` (MIT, no runtime dependencies, 38 KB) draws one background/foreground pair at a contrast threshold; `src/theme/randomTheme.ts` grows it into the 18 non-status semantic colour roles and refuses any draw that misses its threshold (fuzzed: 3,000 themes, zero failing pairs). Status colours keep their authored values because their hue carries meaning. It overrides tier 2 only, inline, so it proves the two-tier contract: no component changes when the whole palette does |
| **An installable package** (2026-10-01) | `npm run build:lib` writes `dist/lib/index.js`, `styles.css` and type declarations; React is a peer dependency, Base UI and randoma11y are external. Library mode inlines the two fonts into `styles.css` (about 200 KB gzipped), the cost of a stylesheet that works with one import. Not published yet |
| **Every colour pair passes WCAG; controls get their own edge** (2026-10-01) | The 14 pairs that failed upstream now pass in both modes (0 of 20 per mode). Light: status text moves to the 700 step. Dark: subtle status backgrounds move to a new 950 step, danger text to red.300, and text on danger fills turns dark, like the accent button. A new role, `border.control` (neutral.600), is the resting edge of the six form controls at 3:1 or more (WCAG 1.4.11); `border.default` stays soft for dividers, and `border.strong` moves a step stronger so hover stays visible. Random palettes theme `border.control` too (19 roles) |
| **Pancake DS is a client template, not a teaching repo** (2026-10-02) | The owner uses it solo now, then forks it per client for prototyping, user testing and handoff (Figma + Dev Mode, coded prototypes, JSON, sometimes the whole repo), and later for production pages. Client brands live in their own fork and Figma file; nothing from client work flows back here. The purpose and thesis sections above still describe the upstream teaching repo and are due a rewrite |
| **Token values sync both ways through LiveDocs, a widget** (2026-10-02) | Every client brand means new token values in one UI kit. Tokens Studio Free lacks themes and multi-file sync, the Figma REST variables API is Enterprise-only, and Figma MCP reads are capped per plan (20 a month on Starter). A widget runs the Plugin API inside Figma for free on any plan. CI publishes `tokens.json` with Storybook; the widget pulls it into variables in place (IDs kept, bindings intact) and exports Figma edits that `tokens:from-figma` writes back. The repo stays the final record: changes from either side arrive as a PR. Details in `docs/token-sync.md` |
| **A baseline decides who changed a token** (2026-10-02) | A difference between Figma and GitHub does not say which side moved, so a naive export would undo changes made on GitHub and a naive SYNC would overwrite edits made in Figma. The widget stores every token's value at the last sync: SYNC applies only GitHub's changes and keeps Figma edits; export sends only Figma edits; both sides changed is a reported conflict. "Pull tokens" stays as the explicit overwrite |
| **The Figma → code import edits values, never formatting** (2026-10-02) | Token files are hand-aligned. `tokens-from-figma.mjs` rewrites one `$value` in the text and re-parses the file to prove nothing else changed; it keeps each token's unit (rem stays rem) and reports, rather than guesses, values Figma derives (line height, letter spacing, font stacks, shadows, motion) |
